# Microsoft SQLServer Tables
The SDE includes a Microsoft SQLServer dump file with several reference tables.
Originally, almost all reference data was included in the SQLServer dump.
The [EVE Development Network](http://wiki.eve-id.net/Category:CCP_DB_Tables) documents
much of the original contents of the dump file.

The current SQLServer dump contains the following tables:

## Corporations Tables
* [NPC Corporations](mssql_crpNPCCorporations.md)<br/>
  Table of all NPC Corporations.

## EVE Tables
* [EVE Units](mssql_eveUnits.md)<br/>
  In game units.

## Inventory Tables
* [Inventory Flags](mssql_invFlags.md)<br/>
  Names of all in-game items.
* [Inventory Names](mssql_invNames.md)<br/>
  Names of all in-game items.
* [Inventory Items](mssql_invItems.md)<br/>
  Table of all in-game items.

## Stations Tables
* [Stations](mssql_staStations.md)<br/>
  Table of all stations.
